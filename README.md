vim-ensime
==========

A vim client for Ensime; written in Python embedded into VimL, passing Lisp
expressions around, all this to be able to write Scala code...

Very early stage, but the basic functionality of the Python client is there.

This code is in the public domain. If you can benefit from it I'd love to hear
about it, but you are by no means obliged to tell me (or anyone else, for that
matter).

You should know that Andrey Popp has been braver than I and pushed the
vim/ensime integration further. I encourage you to ignore my repository and [go
clone his](https://github.com/andreypopp/ensime) instead.
